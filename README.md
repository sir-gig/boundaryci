Catch cross-tenant authorization mistakes before a SaaS migration reaches production.

BoundaryCI is a local-first CLI for Supabase and PostgreSQL projects. It reconstructs the final security state from SQL migrations, applies deterministic tenant-isolation rules, and can optionally ask a Fireworks model to review policy interactions that static rules cannot reliably understand.

> **Current scope:** v0.1 is a migration scanner, not a penetration-testing guarantee. It does not connect to a live database or create synthetic tenants yet. The active two-tenant attack runner is the next product milestone.

## Quick start

```bash
npx boundaryci scan /path/to/your/supabase-project
```

In Windows PowerShell, use `npx.cmd boundaryci scan .` when script execution policy blocks the `npx.ps1` wrapper.

BoundaryCI exits with code `1` when a **new, non-waived** deterministic finding meets the configured threshold, `0` when the scan passes, and `2` for configuration or runtime errors.

The default `auto` profile enables exposed-schema RLS rules when it sees a Supabase directory or Supabase authorization SQL such as `auth.uid()` and `TO authenticated`. Plain server-side PostgreSQL projects do not receive misleading “public schema” RLS findings. Override detection with `--profile supabase` or `--profile postgres`.

Try the intentionally vulnerable example:

```bash
npm run scan:example
```

The example includes two deterministic failures and a subtler membership policy that checks whether the user belongs to *any* organization without correlating that membership to the contract's `organization_id`. The latter exists to exercise the optional Fireworks review.

## What it catches

| Rule | Default severity | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BND001` | High | Exposed table does not enable RLS |
| `BND002` | Medium | RLS is enabled but no policies exist |
| `BND003` | Critical | `anon` or `PUBLIC` receives unconditional row access |
| `BND004` | High | Every authenticated user receives unconditional row access |
| `BND005` | High | `SECURITY DEFINER` function does not pin `search_path` |
| `BND006` | High | `SECURITY DEFINER` function remains executable by `PUBLIC` |

The parser follows migration order and accounts for later RLS changes, policy changes and drops, table drops, function replacement, and `PUBLIC` execute grants/revokes.

## Adopt an existing repository

Create a baseline after reviewing the current deterministic findings:

```bash
npx boundaryci baseline .
git add .boundaryci/baseline.json
```

The normal scan now reports those findings as `BASELINE` and exits successfully. A changed or newly introduced finding receives a stable fingerprint, is marked `NEW`, and can fail CI:

```bash
npx boundaryci scan .
```

Fingerprints ignore line-number and whitespace-only changes. A meaningful change to the vulnerable SQL produces a new fingerprint. Use `--ignore-baseline` to audit everything as new.

When a risk must be accepted temporarily, create an owned waiver using the fingerprint printed by the scan:

```bash
npx boundaryci waive 785692dd876680a9e329bba8 . \
  --owner security-team \
  --reason "Legacy shared table; replacement is tracked in SEC-142." \
  --expires 2026-12-31

git add .boundaryci/waivers.json
```

Waivers require an owner, a reason of at least ten characters, and a valid `YYYY-MM-DD` expiry. They are valid through the expiry date. On the next day, BoundaryCI marks the finding `NEW` again and prints an expiry warning. Commit both adoption files so every developer and CI run uses the same decisions.

Use `--baseline-file` and `--waivers-file` to override their paths. An explicitly supplied path must exist, preventing a typo from silently disabling controls.

## Fireworks semantic review

Deterministic checks should decide whether CI passes. The optional Fireworks review looks for higher-order mistakes such as:

- an update policy that authorizes the old row but allows `tenant_id` reassignment;
- membership checks joined to the wrong tenant field;
- authorization based on user-editable metadata;
- policy and `SECURITY DEFINER` interactions that create a bypass.

In PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:FIREWORKS_API_KEY = "your-key"
npx.cmd boundaryci scan . --fireworks
```

Fireworks findings are advisory by default. To include them in the CI exit decision:

```bash
npx boundaryci scan . --fireworks --include-ai-in-exit-code
```

If Fireworks is unavailable, the deterministic scan still completes and prints a warning. Use `--require-fireworks` when an unavailable semantic review must instead produce exit code `2`:

```bash
npx boundaryci scan . --require-fireworks
```

The integration requests schema-constrained JSON, validates every returned file and field, and redacts common token, JWT, password, secret, and API-key patterns before sending SQL. Redaction is defense-in-depth, not a guarantee: do not store production credentials in migrations. Enabling this option sends migration text to Fireworks under your Fireworks account and data settings.

The default model is `accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-v4-flash`. Override it with `--fireworks-model` or configuration if that model is unavailable to your account.

## Configuration

Create a starter file:

```bash
npx boundaryci init
```

`boundaryci.config.json`:

```json
{
  "databaseProfile": "auto",
  "migrationDirectories": ["supabase/migrations"],
  "exposedSchemas": ["public"],
  "ignoreTables": ["public.schema_migrations", "public.spatial_ref_sys"],
  "failOn": "high",
  "adoption": {
    "baselineFile": ".boundaryci/baseline.json",
    "waiversFile": ".boundaryci/waivers.json"
  },
  "fireworks": {
    "enabled": false,
    "required": false,
    "model": "accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-v4-flash",
    "includeInExitCode": false,
    "maxInputCharacters": 80000
  }
}
```

`ignoreTables` accepts fully qualified names and unqualified table names. Use it only for tables that are intentionally shared or inaccessible through the exposed API.

## Output and CI

Supported formats are terminal output, JSON, SARIF, and native GitHub workflow annotations:

```bash
npx boundaryci scan . --format json --output boundaryci.json
npx boundaryci scan . --format sarif --output boundaryci.sarif
npx boundaryci scan . --format github
npx boundaryci scan . --fail-on critical
```

SARIF and GitHub output contain only `NEW` findings. Pretty and JSON output retain baseline and waived findings for auditability.

This repository includes a published composite [`action.yml`](action.yml). Pin an exact release tag or commit SHA in production. `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` is only required when the `fireworks` input is `true`.

```yaml
name: Tenant isolation
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  boundaryci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: sir-gig/boundaryci@v0.1.7
        with:
          target: .
          fail-on: high
```

The action uses GitHub workflow commands to annotate the exact migration lines. Existing baseline findings and active waivers do not create annotations.

## BoundaryCI Cloud private beta

The paid-product foundation is an opt-in scan-history service. Scanning still happens inside the customer's local environment or GitHub runner. With `--upload`, BoundaryCI sends a minimized result to a repository-bound Cloud endpoint after the local report has been produced:

```powershell
$env:BOUNDARYCI_CLOUD_URL = "https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/ingest-scan"
$env:BOUNDARYCI_CLOUD_TOKEN = "bci_repository_token"
npx.cmd boundaryci scan . --upload --repository owner/repository
```

In GitHub Actions, repository, commit, branch, and pull-request metadata are detected automatically:

```yaml
- uses: sir-gig/boundaryci@v0.1.7
  with:
    target: .
    fail-on: high
    upload: "true"
    cloud-url: ${{ secrets.BOUNDARYCI_CLOUD_URL }}
    cloud-token: ${{ secrets.BOUNDARYCI_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
```

Cloud upload is disabled by default. The payload contains repository identity, commit context, summary counts, finding metadata, and short evidence/remediation snippets. BoundaryCI removes the absolute scan target and migration-file list, excludes local warnings, normalizes finding paths, and applies its common-secret redaction before upload. It does not upload complete migration files. Redaction is defense-in-depth, so teams must still decide whether findings may leave their environment.

The deployable Supabase schema and ingestion Edge Function live in [`cloud/supabase`](cloud/supabase). The control plane binds every ingestion token to one repository, stores only SHA-256 token hashes, makes retries idempotent, enforces subscription status and monthly scan limits, and applies row-level security to every tenant-owned table. See [`cloud/README.md`](cloud/README.md) for its security model and deployment path.

## Product architecture

```text
SQL migrations
    │
    ├── deterministic parser and rules ──┐
    │                                    ├── fingerprints ── baseline / waivers
    └── optional Fireworks review ───────┘
                 advisory by default
                                           │
                                           └── pretty / JSON / SARIF / GitHub ── CI
```

The CLI remains local-first: it does not need database credentials, and deterministic scans make no network requests. Fireworks review and Cloud upload are separate, explicit network features. The Cloud control plane can add organization-wide policy management, historical reporting, and active tenant-boundary tests without moving customer database credentials into a dashboard.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

The test suite includes deliberately vulnerable and secure migration sets, parser state-transition tests, baseline and waiver expiry behavior, GitHub/SARIF output checks, and a mocked Fireworks structured response.

## Why this exists

Object-level authorization remains the first category in the [OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/). RLS is powerful, but a single permissive policy or privileged helper can turn a tenant ID into a data breach. BoundaryCI makes that boundary a repeatable pull-request check rather than a one-time review.

Fireworks integration uses its OpenAI-compatible chat-completions API and [structured response formatting](https://docs.fireworks.ai/structured-responses/structured-response-formatting).
