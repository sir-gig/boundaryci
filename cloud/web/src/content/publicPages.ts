  {
    question: "How do I connect a GitHub repository?",
    answer: "Create the repository in BoundaryCI Cloud, store its one-time token as the GitHub Actions secret BOUNDARYCI_CLOUD_TOKEN, and commit the generated workflow YAML. The token never goes in the file, and the repository dashboard keeps the safe YAML available under Setup guide.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can one workspace monitor multiple repositories?",
    answer: "Yes. An organization owner or administrator can select Add repository in the dashboard. Each repository receives its own bound token, setup guide, and scan history, while usage is counted against the organization's shared monthly allowance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does BoundaryCI connect to my production database?",
    answer: "No. The current scanner analyzes migration files and does not require database credentials. Active testing against disposable environments is a future, separately configured capability.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does BoundaryCI Cloud receive?",
    answer: "Cloud history receives repository and commit context, summary counts, finding metadata, and short redacted evidence and remediation snippets. Complete migration files are excluded from history. If a paid organization separately enables managed AI, up to 80,000 characters of locally redacted migration text pass transiently through BoundaryCI to Fireworks and are not stored by BoundaryCI.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Fireworks AI required?",
    answer: "No. BoundaryCI's deterministic checks work without AI and remain the source of truth for merge decisions. Team, Growth, and Enterprise organizations can authorize BoundaryCI's managed Fireworks review without creating their own Fireworks account, then disable it by organization, repository, or workflow.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this replace a penetration test?",
    answer: "No. BoundaryCI is a focused continuous control for tenant-isolation regressions. It complements threat modeling, code review, testing, and independent security assessments.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I adopt it with existing findings?",
    answer: "Yes. Commit a reviewed baseline, then fail CI only when a new regression appears. Owned, expiring waivers keep temporary exceptions visible.",
