# BoundaryCI Cloud control plane

This directory is the paid BoundaryCI Cloud product: organization and repository setup, repository-bound ingestion keys, durable scan history, tenant-safe reads, Stripe subscriptions, and subscription-aware usage limits.

The scanner remains local. Cloud receives a minimized result only when a customer enables `--upload`; it never needs the customer's database credentials or full migration files.

## Components

- `supabase/migrations/20260718000000_cloud_control_plane.sql` creates organizations, memberships, repositories, hashed ingestion keys, scan runs, findings, indexes, row-level security, onboarding RPCs, and the atomic ingestion RPC.
- `supabase/functions/ingest-scan/index.ts` is the public HTTP boundary. It hashes the bearer token, delegates all authorization and writes to one database transaction, and returns only a scan identifier.
- `supabase/functions/create-checkout/index.ts` creates organization-owned Stripe Checkout sessions for owners and administrators.
- `supabase/functions/create-portal/index.ts` creates short-lived Stripe customer portal sessions for authorized organization managers.
- `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts` verifies Stripe signatures and atomically synchronizes idempotent subscription events.
- `supabase/migrations/20260718010000_stripe_billing.sql` adds the Stripe billing state, event ledger, expanded subscription statuses, and server-only subscription synchronization RPC.
- `../src/cloud.ts` is the CLI payload minimizer and HTTPS upload client.
- `web` is the React dashboard for authentication, organization/repository onboarding,
  one-time token creation, plan usage, scan history, and finding detail.

## Security model

- A plaintext ingestion token is shown once by `create_ingestion_key`; only its SHA-256 hash is stored.
- Every key is bound to one active repository and organization.
- The database verifies that the payload's `owner/repository` matches the key.
- Duplicate `externalId` values return the original run, making retries idempotent.
- Organization members can read only organizations, repositories, runs, and findings for organizations they belong to.
- The ingestion-key table has an explicit deny-all client policy and no authenticated table grants.
- Organization administrators cannot edit plan, subscription, quota, or Stripe fields through client credentials.
- Ingestion stops when a subscription is inactive or its monthly scan allowance is exhausted.
- The Edge Function limits request size and does not expose unexpected database errors.
- Stripe price IDs are mapped to BoundaryCI plans on the server. The browser and webhook metadata cannot grant a plan or quota.
- Stripe webhook event IDs are recorded in the same database transaction as the subscription update, so retries are safe.
- Checkout and portal functions re-check the caller's Supabase identity and owner/admin membership server-side.

## Deploy a beta environment

Create and link a Supabase project, then apply the migration and deploy the function:

```bash
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
supabase db push
supabase functions deploy ingest-scan --no-verify-jwt
supabase secrets set BOUNDARYCI_APP_URL=https://app.boundaryci.com
```

JWT verification is disabled only at the Edge gateway because uploads use a repository-bound BoundaryCI token instead of a Supabase user JWT. The function authenticates that token through the database RPC. `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are supplied to hosted Supabase Edge Functions; never expose the service-role key to the CLI, browser, or GitHub workflow.

## Onboard an organization

The future dashboard should perform these calls with the signed-in user's Supabase JWT:

1. Call `create_organization(name, slug)`. It creates the organization and its first owner atomically.
2. Insert a `repositories` row for a GitHub `owner/repository`. Row-level security requires an owner or administrator.
3. Call `create_ingestion_key(repository_id, name)`. Display the returned plaintext token once and instruct the user to save it as the GitHub secret `BOUNDARYCI_CLOUD_TOKEN`.
4. Store the Edge Function URL as `BOUNDARYCI_CLOUD_URL` and enable the Action's `upload` input.

Billing webhooks must use a server-side service credential to update `plan`, `subscription_status`, `monthly_scan_limit`, and the Stripe identifiers. Those columns are deliberately not writable by authenticated browser clients. A limit of `0` means unlimited scans and should be reserved for contracted Enterprise accounts.

## Configure Stripe Billing

Use Stripe test mode first. Create these four recurring prices under BoundaryCI products:

| Plan | Monthly | Annual |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Team | $49/month | $490/year |
| Growth | $149/month | $1,490/year |

Copy `supabase/billing-secrets.example` to `supabase/.env.billing.local`, replace every placeholder with the BoundaryCI test-mode key, webhook secret, and price IDs, then upload the secrets without putting them in shell history:

```powershell
Copy-Item cloud/supabase/billing-secrets.example cloud/supabase/.env.billing.local
npx.cmd supabase secrets set --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF --env-file cloud/supabase/.env.billing.local
```

Validate the test prices and create or update the dedicated BoundaryCI customer
portal configuration. The command prints the non-secret
`STRIPE_PORTAL_CONFIGURATION_ID`; add it to Supabase secrets before deploying
`create-portal`:

```powershell
cd cloud/supabase
npx.cmd --yes deno run --allow-env --allow-net --env-file=.env.billing.local scripts/configure-stripe.ts
npx.cmd supabase secrets set --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF STRIPE_PORTAL_CONFIGURATION_ID=bpc_YOUR_ID
cd ../..
```

Deploy the authenticated billing functions and the signature-authenticated webhook:

```powershell
npx.cmd supabase functions deploy create-checkout --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF --no-verify-jwt
npx.cmd supabase functions deploy create-portal --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF --no-verify-jwt
npx.cmd supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF --no-verify-jwt
```

In Stripe Workbench, create a webhook destination pointing to:

```text
https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook
```

Subscribe only to:

- `checkout.session.completed`
- `customer.subscription.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`

Copy that destination's signing secret into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and upload the secrets again. Configure the Stripe customer portal to allow payment-method updates, invoice history, cancellation at period end, and switching between the four BoundaryCI prices.

Do not reuse PursuitPilot/day_duh price IDs. A Stripe account can be shared, but each product's prices and webhook metadata must remain distinct. The webhook safely ignores subscriptions whose price IDs are not in the BoundaryCI secret mapping.

## Run the dashboard locally

Use the project's public publishable key, never its secret or service-role key:

```bash
cd cloud/web
cp .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

The production build is static and is deployed by `.github/workflows/deploy-cloud-web.yml`.
Configure these public GitHub repository variables before running that workflow:

- `BOUNDARYCI_SUPABASE_URL`
- `BOUNDARYCI_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `BOUNDARYCI_INGEST_URL`

For the current GitHub Pages public-beta host, add
`https://sir-gig.github.io/boundaryci/` to the Supabase Auth redirect allow list.
The publishable key is intentionally browser-visible. The Supabase secret and legacy
service-role keys must never be placed in Vite variables or GitHub Pages configuration.

## Dashboard scope

The authenticated dashboard now uses these read models:

- organization overview: newest runs, pass rate, and new findings by severity;
- repository page: run history by commit and branch;
- scan page: finding evidence, recommendation, and disposition;
- onboarding: organization, repository, and one-time ingestion-token creation;
- plan usage is visible.
- owners and administrators can purchase Team or Growth monthly/annual plans;
- subscription, renewal, cancellation, and payment-problem states are webhook-driven;
- customers manage payment methods, invoices, plan changes, and cancellation in Stripe's hosted portal.

After five design-partner repositories are sending real runs, prioritize the workflow customers repeatedly request rather than expanding into a generic security dashboard.
